# xNUWA - Your Entrace to the x402 AI service ecosystem

[Check out the app!](https://xnuwa.app)

We are building to offer you the best AI client app for accessing **x402 AI services**, forked from the [original Nuwa Client](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/nuwa-client). This local-first and user-friendly chat experience lets you create, share, and interact with x402 based AI Cap ecosystem.

> **Caps** (i.e. capability) are mini-apps in Nuwa AI, the minimium functional AI unit. Cap is designed to be an abstraction of AI models and agents. Currently it is the composation of Prompt, Model, MCP Servers and UI. Learn more about Cap on our [official docs](https://docs.nuwa.dev/introduction/core-concepts/capabilities).

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Decentralized Identity & Crypto Payment
- **Anonymous Identity**: You control your data with your EVM address, fully anonymous
- **Crypto Payment**: Use cryptos to pay for your day-to-day AI
- **Data Portability**: Export and migrate your data anywhere

### 🎨 Modern User Experience
- **Shadcn UI**: Clean, responsive design with dark/light theme and multi-lin support
- **No MCP Configuration**: MCPs use DID authentication directly, eliminates the need for user to config


## 🚀 Alpha Release

We're excited to announce the **xNUWA Alpha Release**! This release includes:

- ✅ x402 Client-Side integration - x402 MCP client follows the [official spec](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/2daa42f6a0e5a36c1bb19677fda2a74a6b466b06/specs/transports/mcp.md?plain=1)
- ✅ native wallet integration - encrypted, non-exportable privatekey stored in IndexedDB; sign transaction with PIN code or Passkey
